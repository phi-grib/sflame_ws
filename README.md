# sFlame_ws

sFlame_ws provides a simple web interface for managing existing spaces and running similarity search. 

sFlame_ws is in active development and **no stable release has been produced so far**. Even this README is under construction, so please excuse errors and inaccuracies.

## Installing
sFlame_ws asumes that Flame (https://github.com/phi-grib/flame) is already installed and reachable in the *PYTHONPATH*. In development environments where Flame is installed in another location, the full path must be defined (hardcoded) at the top of file `sflame-ws.py`. 

The server is started by typing:

```sh
conda activate flame
cd sflame_ws/
python sflame-ws.py 
```	

To access the web graphical interface, open a web browser and enter the address *http://localhost:8081*

The web page contains two tabs

### sManage

![Alt text](images/flame-ws-smanage.png?raw=true "smanage tab")

The page is divided in three regions:
* Spaces available. A list of existing spaces and versions, in an expandable tree
* Space details. A detailed description of the space selected in the space tree view
* Tools. A toolbox with commands which can be executed

| Command | Equivalent Flame command | Description |
| --- | --- | ---|
| Clone | *python -c smanage -a publish -s NEWSPACE* | Clones the development version, creating a new version in the space repository. Versions are assigned sequential numbers |
| Export | *python -c smanage -a export -s NEWSPACE* | Exports the space entry NEWSPACE, creating a tar compressed file *NEWSPACE.tgz* which contains all the versions. |
| Delete Space| *python -c smanage -a kill -s NEWSPACE* | Removes NEWSPACE from the space repository. **Use with extreme care**, since the removal will be permanent and irreversible  |
| Delete Version | *python -c smanage -a remove -s NEWSPACE -v 2* | Removes the version specified from the NEWSPACE space repository |
| New space | *python -c smanage -a new -s NEWSPACE* | Creates a new entry in the space repository  |
| Import | *python -c smanage -a import -s NEWSPACE* | Imports file *NEWSPACE.tgz*, creating space NEWSPACE in the local space repository |

### Search

![Alt text](images/flame-ws-search.png?raw=true "Search tab")

Select a SDFile in the *Input* field, using the browse button. Select the *space* and *version* and press the *Search* button. After a short while, the results are shown in tabular format.

Results can be exported to a .tsv formatted file pressing the *Export* button.
